1) First of All We Create a Function with name sort and parameters as n and a pointer.
2) We Initialize a for loop to compare the pointer variable that are pointing towards the base address of the array.
3) By using if statement to compare the two base addresses we arrange the base addresses in descending order.
4) We use an Reverse For loop to print the Output in Ascending order.
5) In the main program, we declare a variable n with a certain value and an array with a specific set of members. Then we pass those parameters into a function call as sort(n,arr);
6) The sort function calls the above mentioned sort function and performs the task as mentioned above.
