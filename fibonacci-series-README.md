1) First a is initialized as 0 and b is initialized as 1.
2) Fibonacci series means each number is obtained by the addition of previous 2 numbers. So We start with 2 Numbers 0 and 1.
3) Inside the For loop the Program just adds the previous 2 numbers and assigns the values to respective variables.

For Eg: First a is 0 and b is 1. Then c = a+b gives c=1. The value of a is passed on to b by a=b. So New Value of a=1.
Then value of b is stored in c. So This Program just keeps on adding the previous two numbers and displaying the output until the user fed in Number is reached.
